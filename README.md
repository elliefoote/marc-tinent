## Overview and goals

This is a portfolio website that I developed for a freelance client who is a professional writer.

The purpose of the site is to provide information for both editors and readers of Marc's work. He also wanted to maintain a consistent visual identity with his Instagram profile.

## Stack

- **Framework** - GatsbyJS
- **Data layer** - GraphQL, integrated with Instagram Graph API
- **Styling** - Bootstrap 5, custom CSS, react-masonry for layout
- **Hosting/Deployment** - Netlify, together with Zapier integration that re-deploys project whenever a new post is uploaded to Instagram

## Future features

- Integrate site with a headless CMS, so Marc can update / add content himself
