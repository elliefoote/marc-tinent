## Overview and goals
This is a portfolio website that I developed for a freelance client who is a professional writer. 

The purpose of the site is to provide information for both editors and readers of Marc's work. He also wanted to maintain a consistent visual identity with his Instagram profile. 

## What I learned
I used GatsbyJS to develop the site, which gave me the chance to further develop my skills with the framework. 

I also learned a lot about the type of information Google uses to rank sites, as it was important for Marc's site to be easy for readers and editors to find. It's currently ranked # 1 when searching on Google for his name.

## Future features
In the future, I will incorporate a feed of the most recent posts from Marc's Instagram.
